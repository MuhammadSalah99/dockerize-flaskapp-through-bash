# This is my code for the second Task 


I used docker-compose.yaml to build and run multiple images and thier containers.

### To Run use ```/spin-up.bash admin admin db``` 
Note you might need to run ```cmmod +x ./spin-up.sh``` to make the scipt excutable

it will be running on [http://localhost:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
